            <p id="mh4t">This website is my first (of many hopefully) website that I built myself from scratch! Its layout is inspired very heavily on another ePortfolio I made two years ago with the help of Wix (of which you can visit <a href="https://luisangelarroyo.wixsite.com/angelarroyo">here</a> if you'd like to see it!)</p>
            <p id="mh4t">I'm still a relatively new transfer here at Kennesaw State University, with the previous Fall 2024 semester being my first here, so I can't share much content regarding KSU.</p>
            <p id ="mh4t">However, as you'll be able to see in my page - About me - I've learned and done plenty both here and at my previous institution!</p>
