            <!--<h3 id="main"><a href="main.html">Click me to go back to main</a></h3> this was my orginal code when i made the tabs, however, i changed it because it would just make text with a hyperlink to the page... i wanted responsive tabs so i changed it to buttons-->

            <p id="mh4t">What you're seeing right now is what I hope to use in the future as where I post updates in my life, professionally and personally, almost like an old school web blog.</p>
            <p id="mh4t">Addtionally, in the future, I'd like to add a little puzzle/password box here where it will encourage users to go to the other pages and look for digits for the password. Once they find them all and enter them in the correct order... either a thank you pops up or it'll redirect you to a thank you page and maybe have a basic html game</p>
            <p id="mh4t">Seeing as how I'm making this like an update page... I really hope to also implement a mini quiz of sorts on the about me page... like just a simple questionaire about what they read</p>
