            <p id="mh4at">Hello to all who reads this, I am Luis Angel Arroyo (but you can just call me Angel) and I am 21 year old Mexican-American student proudly born and raised in Dalton, Georgia. I previously had attended my hometown college of Dalton State but recently transferred to  Kennesaw State University to wrap up my degree in Information Technology and should graduate by Fall of 2026. Currently, I am interested in pursuing careers in creative tech like Web Development/Design, Graphic Design, Music Technology, jobs of that sort.</p>
            <p id="mh4at">Although I may be fairly new to KSU, I've already learned and picked up quite a few skills. I began programming my freshman year of high school with Python and Java and, throughout the years toying around with the languages and taking multiple classes in high school and college, can confidently say I am fluent and comfortable with the two languages. I've also taken a 3 part course on CCNA 1, 2, and 3 and have a good understanding of network concepts and practices. I also have certifications in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and have taken additional courses on Office applications (like Excel and Access) and Windows 10 OS.</p>
            <p id="mh4at">Besides that though, I have a deep desire to pursue the creative field and I stem it all back to my experience in my high school's marching band. I have notes with hundreds of ideas I've had throughout the years and, once I'm finished with college, would like to make come to fruition. Additionally, I'd like to go back to school and complete another degree in education so I can go back to my local high school to teach either music or computer science and pay it forward. Once I am done with school I'd like to go into the tech field pursuing jobs with creative backgrounds/bases such as Web Design. In addition to that, I also have planned to go back to school to get another degree in either Music Education or Music Technology and hopefully one day be able to work for a bit with my high school's marching band program. But, I am just taking life one day at a time so, if I see an opportunity outside of this, I will take it!</p>
            <!-- i should add that, once i made it into a website, the about page is very clearly not formatted for mobile devices... so I know moving foward i should focus on implementing the mobile interface-->
             <!-- This page is definietly what I will be working on while implementing the node.js....-->
